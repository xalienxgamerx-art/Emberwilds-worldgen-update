/**
 * The local news layer — a small semantic query layer between the living
 * world and NPC dialogue. Residents and recruiters never embed world logic
 * into strings: they ask the queries below what is nearby and phrase the
 * answer. Any future NPC (travelers, chapter officers, caravans) can reuse
 * the same queries.
 *
 * Monster reports follow a strict information hierarchy, first source wins:
 *
 *   1. nearby active creatures   (what is actually out there now)
 *   2. nearby monster territories (claimed home ranges)
 *   3. nearby monster lairs       (landmarks on the map)
 *   4. regional monster ecology   (what the land supports)
 *   5. biome fallback             (the land itself)
 *
 * Every answer is spatially *vague* — compass bearings and rough reaches,
 * never coordinates. Exploration, the map and the territory system stay the
 * player's own tools.
