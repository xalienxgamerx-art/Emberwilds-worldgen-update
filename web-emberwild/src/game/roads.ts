 * Roads — the national road network as a pure function of the seed.

 *   → terrain-aware routes (weighted A*) → physical road tiles
 *
 * The logical network (which settlement connects to which, by which class of
 * road) is kept separate from its physical realization (the road tiles on the
 * ground), so future systems can reason about connectivity without re-reading
 * terrain. Nothing is persisted: like every world system, the whole network is
 * a deterministic function of the world seed, rebuilt lazily and cached.
 *
 * Determinism rules the build: settlements are enumerated row-major, every
 * candidate list is sorted with stable tie-breaks, Prim's MST breaks ties by
 * node id, routes are surveyed in (length, id) order, and all chance comes
 * from subsystem hash streams (the `seed ^ 0x90ad` family) — never from a
 * shared random stream whose consumption order could vary.
