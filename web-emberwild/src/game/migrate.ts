/**
 * Save migration — the versioned pipeline every loaded save passes through,
 * extracted from the store so it can be exercised headlessly (mapcheck and
 * unit tests run the exact code the game runs).
 *
 * Architecture, unchanged from the store:
 *  - one chain of guarded steps, oldest version first;
 *  - every recent step is idempotent and re-runs on every load, so a save
 *    written by an older build upgrades in one pass and stays stable;
 *  - generated world data (settlements, roads, NPCs, associations) is never
 *    persisted — it is a pure function of `gs.seed` and is rebuilt on load.
 *
 * Phase 8 additions:
 *  - a malformed save (wrong shape, missing seed/player) is refused with a
 *    diagnostic instead of half-loading into a broken state;
 *  - a save from a NEWER game version is refused — silently downgrading it
 *    would invent missing state and then overwrite the real save.
