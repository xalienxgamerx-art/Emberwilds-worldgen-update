/**
 * Growth & physical size (Phase 8) — the lifecycle layer between genetics and
 * the world.
 *
 * Pipeline (one direction, no shortcuts):
 *
 *   genetics (size alleles)  →  mature phenotype (expressed size)
 *   →  growth stage (newborn / juvenile / mature / elder)
 *   →  physical size  →  footprint class, stat scaling, food & space demand
 *
 * Combat, movement, rendering, reproduction and ecology consume these results
 * through the exported helpers; none of them compute size themselves. All
 * thresholds and scaling weights live in the constants block so balance is a
 * tuning exercise, not a rewrite.
 *
 * Compatibility: a body without growth data (`bornTick === undefined`, the
 * state of every wild adult and every pre-Phase-8 save) is treated as mature,
 * and a mature body's footprint is exactly what `sizeToFootprint` always
 * produced — so existing saves, rendering and placement are unchanged.
